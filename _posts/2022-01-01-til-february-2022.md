### February 2022

- Apple Maps (MapKit) integration is _almost_ free. (_MapKit JS beta provides a free daily limit of 250,000 map views and 25,000 service calls per Apple Developer Program membership._)
- react(rendering and context): The component right under your context provider should probably use memo. ([alexsidorenko](https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-render-cheat-sheet/))
- remix: If your server side modules end up in client bundles, move the imports for those modules to a file named {something}.server.ts with the .server.ts suffix to ensure they are excluded. ([remix.run](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/data-loading))
