title: "Clipped text in CSS"
---

<p>It made my day the other day. Ever struggled when your text didn&#8217;t fit into its box and you needed to clip it? Forget any fancy solutions you tried. It&#8217;s simple like using <code>text-overflow: ellipsis</code>. It makes three periods to be appended to text.</p>

<p>It does not work in Firefox (but works in IE6, can you believe it?), but who cares. Use some javascript script or firefox bindings for this.</p>
