title: "TIL: February 2020"
---

Inspired by [@theodorton](https://github.com/theodorton)'s
[TIL: January 2020](https://theodorton.github.io/til-january-2020/]),
here is my take on last month's TILs.

- Nearly 4.5mln cases of influenza have been confirmed in 2018/19 season
  in Poland only. It's more than 10% of whole population.
  6% of those required hospital intervention.
  150 cases ended in death.

- `add_column :users, :some_column, :text, default: "default_value"`
  is safe in Postgres 11+, MySQL 8.0.12+, and MariaDB 10.3.2+.
  (source : [strong_migrations#adding-a-column-with-a-default-value](https://github.com/ankane/strong_migrations#adding-a-column-with-a-default-value))

- [sucker_punch](https://github.com/brandonhilkert/sucker_punch) looks to
  be reasonable choice for your background jobs processor if heroku bills scare you off.

- CSS selector for namespaces is "|", so for example if you're looking
  for `<content:encoded>`, the selector should be `content|encoded`.

- Rails. If you have a column named `type` and don't want to use it as
  a STI discriminator column, you can "disable" with
  `self.inheritance_column = :_type_disabled`.

- `fetch` follows redirects, use `redirect: manual` to disable it.

- iTerm2. You can enable Option+Arrow to skip words by
  [turning natural text editing on](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/293988).
