title: "PHP date conversions between timezones"
---

<p>In PHP 5.x line dates are handled properly (thanks to Derick Rethans). Even <a href="http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.3.0">in PHP 5.3 we have loads of nice date/time improvements</a>.</p>
<p>One of nice things is posibility to convert dates between timezones easily.</p>
