### February

- Apple Maps (MapKit) integration is _almost_ free. (_MapKit JS beta provides a free daily limit of 250,000 map views and 25,000 service calls per Apple Developer Program membership._)
- react(rendering and context): The component right under your context provider should probably use memo. ([alexsidorenko](https://alexsidorenko.com/blog/react-render-cheat-sheet/))
