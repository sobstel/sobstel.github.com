title: "Readable MySQL-like output in rails console or irb"
---

<p>Ever wanted to make <em>irb</em> or <em>rails console</em> output a little more clear and readable? At least something like from <em>mysql console</em>?</p>
<p>You should try <em>hirb</em> for nice output and <em>wirble</em> for nice colouring.</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/821275.js?file=hirb%26wirble.rb"></script></p>
<p>And that&#8217;s it. Enjoy it. It made my day the other day.</p>
