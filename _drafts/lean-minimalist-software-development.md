title: Lean / Minimalist Software Development
---

Split into small batches. Really small user stories. Each deliverable and shippable.

It makes everyone happy. Product owners and stakeholders and developers (there's nothing more
motivating than someting that works).

And if things go wrong, it's easier to sacrifice and live with waste of 3 days of work of 1-2 guys rather than 1 month of whole development team.

Kaizen philosophy -> continous improvement in small steps.

Minimalism is not about doing less. It's about not doing not important things, so we have time
for things that we really care about.

1. Eliminate Waste  5. Deliver Fast
2. Build Quality In 6. Respect People
3. Create Knowledge 7. Optimize the Whole
4. Defer Commitment

In a nutshell, Lean says to relentlessly eliminate anything that isn’t adding value and only work on what we absolutely need to be doing at this moment in time. Eliminating waste means eliminating useless meetings, tasks and documentation. But it also means eliminating time spent building what “we know” we’ll need in the future (things are constantly changing so we often end up not needing them – or if we do, we have to rework them because conditions and our understanding has changed by then). It also means eliminating inefficient ways of working – like multitasking (!) – so we can deliver fast.

Lean also puts a very strong emphasis on what it calls “the system” – that is, the way that the team operates as a whole. We always need to be looking at our work from a top level to ensure we’re optimizing for the whole. For example, many managers want to “optimize” individual developers by ensuring they’re always at 100% – but most of the time, this is actually counter-productive. Let’s not have people coding something that isn’t needed (or fully defined yet) just for the sake of coding, because that actually creates more work for us in the future (see: Why You Should Let Your Developers Surf).

Along those lines, Lean says to respect that the people doing the work are the ones that best know how to do it. Give them what they need to be effective and then trust them to do it. Software development is about learning, so structure the work to ensure we’re continuously learning. And because of that, defer decisions until the last responsible moment (because we’ll know more by then). Finally, develop in a way that builds quality into our product, because there’s no way to continuously deliver fast if we have to keep going back to clean up our messes.

“Organizations that are truly lean have a strong competitive advantage because they respond very rapidly and in a highly disciplined manner to market demand, rather than try to predict the future.” – Mary Poppendieck

### Eliminate Waste

3 general forms of waste

* Muda (unproductive)
* Mura (unevenness, inconsistency)
* Muri (over-burden, unreasonableness)

unnecessary code or functionality
starting more than can be completed
delay in the software development process
unclear or constantly changing requirements
bureaucracy
slow or ineffective communication
partially done work
defects and quality issues
task switching

retrospective to discuss what went well. Identifying and eliminating waste should not be a rare event

a culture of continous improvement

meaningful and actionable improvements that actually help you to frequently identify and, more importantly, eliminate waste (assigned to person)

### Build Quality In

By doing development in small incremental steps, through close collaboration, and by developing in small iterations, these agile methods provide the opportunity for constant 2-way feedback between the Product Owner and the team. This feedback can be immensely valuable, inspecting and adapting the product every single day in order to ensure the right level of quality – and most importantly of all – the right product.

Frequent Integration. Most agile methods also advocate doing regular and frequent builds. At least daily, if not hourly. Extreme Programming advocates continuous integration, with code integrated into the overall system, built and automatically unit tested as soon as it is checked in.

Automation Agile development methods also encourage automated regression testing.
TDD. BDD. In-house tester. Whatever.

Managing Trade-offs
One word of warning though. Quality is only one dimension of the project – the others being time, cost and scope.
This is judgemental decision, need to know where to draw the line.

### Create Knowledge

We’ve all had situations where there’s only one developer that can work on something, at least productively, or even at all. Nothing beats the knowledge that’s created when someone actually writes the code.

Code reviews
Documentation / Wiki (README driven docs!!!!)
Smartly commented code (no redundant easy-to-forget-and-miss docs)
Knowledge sharing sessions
Training

### Defer Commitment

decide as late as possible
particularly for decisions that are irreversible, or at least will be impractical to reverse.

you can safely leave critical decisions, the more information you will have available to make the right decision when the time comes.

Deferring irreversible decisions means you keep your options open for as long as possible.

Deciding too early, you run the very likely risk that something significant will have changed, meaning your end product might meet the spec, but it might still be the wrong product! This is one reason why so many projects fail.

### Deliver Fast

It is common to over-engineer solutions, both in terms of the software architecture, and also the business requirements.

Speed to market is undoubtedly a competitive advantage.

Have the Right People.  As with any methodology, it’s important to have the right people.  Lean thinking in the manufacturing industry originally changed the way companies think about their people.  Instead of factory lines where the principle is to standardise everything to the extent that all people are performing small routine tasks and are essentially interchangeable, they moved towards the idea of having ‘thinking people’.  People who are able to think for themselves, solve problems, be proactive, be flexible, take appropriate actions, make decisions.

Keep It Simple.  Another way to go faster, as I eluded to earlier, is to keep things simple.  Keep the requirements simple.  Keep the technical solution simple.  Find the easiest way to meet the users’ goals.  Don’t over-engineer.  Don’t spend too long considering future requirements that may never materialise.  Get something simple to market and build on it based on real customer feedback.

### Respect People

I think it’s important to treat everyone with the same respect, whatever their job.  It doesn’t matter whether they’re the CEO, a developer, project manager, the receptionist or the cleaner, respect everyone equally.

First of all, it means responding to people promptly, listening attentively, hearing their opinions and not dismissing them even when they are different to your own.  It means encouraging people to have their say.  Having empathy for their point of view and trying to see things from their perspective. But, of course, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you should always agree with them!  That would be a very unhealthy situation.  So one of the arts of respecting people is learning how to be assertive and disagree with a point of view, without sounding aggressive or threatening or just plain argumentative.

respecting people is giving people the responsibility to make decisions about their work.  To achieve this, it’s important to build knowledge and develop people who can think for themselves.  People who can think for themselves and  are experts in their area often need to be empowered to feel respected.

### Optimise The Whole

One of the principles of agile methods that has resulted from this experience is the idea that the best way to organise teams is so they are complete, multi-disciplined, co-located product teams that have all the roles and skills they need to deliver a request from start to finish, without reference to other teams.
