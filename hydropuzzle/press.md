### DESCRIPTION

HYDROPUZZLE is a surreal adventure puzzle for iOS and Android. The game is simple, short, linear, odd... but it's a lot of fun as many gamers truly enjoy it.

Chances are you probably haven't played anything like this before.

Refreshed Hydropuzzle 2.0 has been released on 7th Nov 2018 for Android and 8th Dec 2018 for iOS.

### STORY

Step into the shoes of a tech-savvy superhero with your brain as your primary weapon to solve the mystery of water disappearing from a whole city. The superhero is not really a Superman-style athlete. Rather than outrunning express trains, you spend most of your time on your smartphone trying to hack through the story. On top of that, you’re confronted with a bizarre cast of characters that include an enigmatic professor, an evil doctor, a maharaja, a drunken gateman, radioactive fish and a cyber-crocodile.

Hydropuzzle offers unique gameplay, challenging puzzles and a quite peculiar look at a smartphone-obsessed society.
