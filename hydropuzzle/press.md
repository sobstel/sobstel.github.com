### DESCRIPTION

HYDROPUZZLE is a stylish adventure puzzle for iOS. The game is simple, short, linear, odd... but it's a lot of fun as many gamers truly enjoy it.

Chances are you probably haven't played anything like this before.

Totally refreshed **ver 2.0** is set for release on **8th Dec 2018**.

### STORY

Step into the shoes of a tech-savvy superhero with your brain as your primary weapon to solve the mystery of water disappearing from a whole city. The superhero is not really a Superman-style athlete. Rather than outrunning express trains, you spend most of your time on your smartphone trying to hack through the story. On top of that, youâ€™re confronted with a bizarre cast of characters that include an enigmatic professor, an evil doctor, a maharaja, a drunken gateman, radioactive fish and a cyber-crocodile.

Hydropuzzle offers unique gameplay, challenging puzzles and a quite peculiar look at a smartphone-obsessed society.
