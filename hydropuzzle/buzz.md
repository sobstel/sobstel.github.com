_I loved this little experience. I had to come at each chapter from different angles, googling concepts and ideas, and seeing what clicked. Lots of fun. I can see the care and creativity that went into this and hope too see more from the developer soon._

_I‚Äôve never seen a game like this before. It is short and very challenging. But was really fun to play and had a clever story._
<br><small>(Fishbowl z)</small>

_Great game, just the way I like it. Puzzles challenging yet solvable. No time limit. Test intelligence not how fast your nerves work. Stylish._
<br><small>(Áµ≤Èöπ)</small>

_Puzzle games usually lack any style. Or at least they all seem to copy each other. I absolutely loved the style/feel of this game. The story development and the imagery were fantastic._

_Awesomeness for geeks. Challenge the nerd in you and geek out! Surprising and actually challenging._
<br><small>(Pinky6677)</small>

_Short and Sweet. I loved it even if it was a little short. The puzzles were very interesting and it really simulated your brain for prior and current knowledge._

_Really fun and challenging! Took me a good hour to beat it. Sometimes you have to stare at the puzzle until something clicks, but it‚Äôs rewarding when it does! Looking forward to more of these games!_
<br><small>(ChriCar)</small>

_Most enjoyable challenging puzzle in a long time!
I enjoyed this app immensely and highly recommend anyone who is up for a challenge to take it on! I loved the style and inspirations this was based on. A lot of thought was put into each puzzle and hint, and unlike many, you have to work for the solutions, with nothing being a giveaway like in many puzzle apps. BRAVO üëè to the team that put this together, I sincerely hope there will be future chapters for us to foil drevil‚Äôs plans. Please keep this work of art going!_

_It‚Äôs neat. Odd. Puzzles are challenging._

_If you don't mind a good challenge with puzzles that ask you to look outside the game for information or have outside knowledge, give it a try. But it is not an easy game._

_I love Hydropuzzle but man it makes me feel stupid!_

_I have lost the notion of time trying to solve some of the puzzles._

_Hydropuzzle is obviously a labour of love_
