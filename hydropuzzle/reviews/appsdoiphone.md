is well done and is currently free on the App Store.  
</p>
<p>
In Hydropuzzle, we are faced with a surreal story, where we have a city with water shortage, and after a request for help from some internauts, it will have to  be us, supposedly great hackers, to unravel the mystery and find out who is behind the disappearance of the water.
</p>
<p>
  As great masters of puzzles and hackers of very complex security systems, we can solve everything from our mobile phone. After being contacted by a strange teacher, who gives us tips on how to solve the mystery, we will have to follow the clues, solve the puzzles as they appear before us, until we get to the heart of the matter.  
</p>
<p>
The hints to solve the puzzle tend to be in the text that precedes the puzzle, in a series of images shown to us, or even in the same puzzle with animations we have to watch carefully to reach a conclusion. Get ready to go to the internet for one puzzle or another, since it is necessary to think a little bit outside of the box to come up with some solutions.
</p>
<p>
  It's only seven chapters, and I believe there are some who solve the mystery in less than an hour, but most of you, get ready to spend a couple of hours on it. I have lost the notion of time trying to solve some of the puzzles, being so attuned with the jigsaw in question.
</p>
<p>
  You can watch a short video presentation of the game below, and I just ask you not to give up, because the game is very funny, and it even has a few Monty Python type jokes. The puzzles follow the logic mostly. We just need to pay attention to the signs and clues to solve the 7 chapters of this mystery that make us thirsty for more.
