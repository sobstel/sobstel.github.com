### GOOD REVIEWS

_Great game, just the way I like it. Puzzles challenging yet solvable. No time limit. Test intelligence not how fast your nerves work. Stylish._
<br><small>(絲隹)</small>

_Puzzle games usually lack any style. Or at least they all seem to copy each other. I absolutely loved the style/feel of this game. The story development and the imagery were fantastic._
<br><small>(devxm)</small>

_Most enjoyable challenging puzzle in a long time!
I enjoyed this app immensely and highly recommend anyone who is up for a challenge to take it on! I loved the style and inspirations this was based on. A lot of thought was put into each puzzle and hint, and unlike many, you have to work for the solutions, with nothing being a giveaway like in many puzzle apps. BRAVO 👏 to the team that put this together, I sincerely hope there will be future chapters for us to foil drevil’s plans. Please keep this work of art going!_

_I loved this little experience. I had to come at each chapter from different angles, googling concepts and ideas, and seeing what clicked. Lots of fun. I can see the care and creativity that went into this and hope too see more from the developer soon._
<br><small>(Paul No. 2)</small>

_I’ve never seen a game like this before. It is short and very challenging. But was really fun to play and had a clever story._
<br><small>(Fishbowl z)</small>

_Super short but nice. Endearing little puzzle game. I never got really stuck on puzzles, though I almost did on the railway crossing. Note that some puzzles require looking things up. I imagine many people would be upset with paying for such a short game, but if you've got money to spare, I for one enjoyed it._
<br><small>(OsthatoAlfakyn)</small>

_Awesomeness for geeks. Challenge the nerd in you and geek out! Surprising and actually challenging._
<br><small>(Pinky6677)</small>

_Short and Sweet. I loved it even if it was a little short. The puzzles were very interesting and it really simulated your brain for prior and current knowledge._
<br><small>(sarahxyo)</small>

_Really fun and challenging! Took me a good hour to beat it. Sometimes you have to stare at the puzzle until something clicks, but it’s rewarding when it does! Looking forward to more of these games!_
<br><small>(ChriCar)</small>

_If you don't mind a good challenge with puzzles that ask you to look outside the game for information or have outside knowledge, give it a try. But it is not an easy game._
<br><small>([App Unwrapper](https://appunwrapper.com/2018/02/20/my-week-unwrapped-january-20-2018/))</small>

_I have lost the notion of time trying to solve some of the puzzles._

_I love Hydropuzzle but man it makes me feel stupid!_

### BAD REVIEWS

_Hydropuzzle is obviously a labour of love. Unfortunately, if it is judged purely as a game then it falls short on most counts. The game is priced cheaply and if you are the sort of person who loves pondering over your favourite cryptic crossword then you may get some fun from Hydropuzzle. However, for the rest of us, the puzzles are just too obscure and frustrating and the structure too rigid._
<br><small>(<a href="https://www.pockettactics.com/reviews/review-hydropuzzle/">Pocket Tactics</a>)</small>

_Good for some not for stupid people. I only got the first one. Must be dumb. I wish I was a nerd._
<br><small>(BpoBpo)</small>

_Too short. I'd pay for this if it was about 10 times longer. Took me around an hour to complete._
<br><small>(Neil LX)</small>

_Super headache inducing, blinky, and awkward. The first puzzle is mildly interesting, the second is awful, and the third didn't make up for the second._
