  <header>Have you worked in a distributed team before? If so, what things have you learned about working effectively this way?</header>

  <p>I have.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Remote team (6 devs) in Poland. Turkish stakeholder and product owner. (~2 years)</li>
    <li>Distributed development team. 5 devs in Katowice, Poland. 2 devs in Hague, Holland. Product owners in UK. (~2 years)</li>
    <li>Distributed development team. 2 devs in Katowice, Poland. 2 devs in Hague, Holland. Product owners in Holland. (~2 years)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>And I have learned quite a few things...</p>

  <h3>FLOW</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch07_Alone_Time.php">You need uninterrupted time to get things done</a>.
    That's why <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jason_fried_why_work_doesn_t_happen_at_work?language=en">work doesn't happen at work</a>.
    People crowded in the office means too many distractions, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/3uyRWGJ.jpg">too many interruptions</a>
    and too many people around to talk with. Simply too many excuses not to do actual work.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's so much easier to get into the flow (the zone) when you work remotely. It's even better when you're not constrained by 9-5 chains.
    Then it becomes surprising how many things you can do faster.
  </p>

  <h3>SMALL TEAMS</h3>
  <p>
    I believe it's important to keep remote teams small. Otherwise, it hurts efficiency.
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    It's all about communication paths. There's just one communication path between 2&nbsp;people, but it grows exponentially with every single person added to a project.
    Avoiding misunderstandings and good communication is crucial for remote work to be done properly.
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>SMALL BATCHES OF WORK</h3>
  <p>
    Split work into small batches. It's done faster. It's released faster. Remote workers do not disappear for days or weeks doing a thing nobody has a clue about.
    Regular updates or daily morning calls sometimes help here too.
  </p>

  <h3>CODE REVIEWS</h3>
  <p>
    This a real place where you meet coders, when you learn they approach, how they solve problems, where you set up common standards, etc.
    No matter it sometimes hurts...
  </p>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h3>FREEDOM</h3>
  <p>
    More time for extra activities, more time for friends and family, no time wasted for commuting, possibility to change a scenery
    (even if it's just different room at home), flexible to do nice things whenever you want...
    like <a href="/img/xteam/running.jpg">running in the mountains early spring</a>.
    If you can plan your day on your own, it just has huge positive impact on your productivity at work.
  </p>

  <h3>EMPATHY</h3>
  <p>
    It's a bit easier to misunderstand and get angry at each other than in face-to-face talk.
    Remote work requires more understanding and empathy. It's hard though...
  </p>

  </p>

  <h3>MEETINGS</h3>
  <p>
    Meetings are toxic. Skype/hangout call and shared screen tends to be more productive and brings more value than usual on-site meeting.
  </p>

  <h3>GLOBAL CHANNEL IS FUN</h3>
  <p>
    Global channel (or random team cahnnel) at company's communicator is often a lot of fun ;-)

  <header>Also, can you tell me about a time where you used some form of automated testing, and what value did that add to the project?</header>

  <p>
    Truth to be told I've been developing projects either almost fully test-covered as well as zero-test ones.
  </p>

  <p>
    There's one most important value of testing to me. <strong>Regressions.</strong>
    Just being able to check if feature that you currently fix or develop doesn't break something else.
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="/img/xteam/bug-vs-feature.jpg">
  </p>

  <p>
    But <a href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/2014/tdd-is-dead-long-live-testing.html">I usually do not write software test-first.</a>
  </p>

  <p>
    And writing good tests is hard.
  </p>

  <p>
    To name a few challenges...
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Mocks. If you want to write truly isolated unit tests, there's sometimes a lot of mocking involved. It makes you never test real-life situation, like some problem that doesn't exist.
    </li>
    <li>
      Testing for the sake of testing, eg. testing getters and setters.
      <a href="http://www.databonanza.com/2012/08/the-evils-of-code-coverage-and-other.html">Code coverage is probably most misleading metric ever invented</a>.
      Working software and small number of regression bugs. That's what matters. Clients don't care about code coverage.
    </li>
    <li>
      Long running tests. More tests, longer time to run, slower time to deploy to production.
      There are no tests ever that will cover all fail scenarios. Bugs will always happen. It's important to be able to hotfix and release them quickly.
      Not that it should happen often of course ;-)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The problem also is developers tend to write complex software. Then they write even more complex tests on top of it.
    If we could just understand that <em>"we are not paid to use every feature of the language, but we are paid to write reliable and simple software."</em>
    (Douglas Crockford), then maybe <a href="https://medium.com/@webseanhickey/the-evolution-of-a-software-engineer-db854689243#.ajzetole0">our evolution could go into right direction</a> ;-)
  </p>

  <p>
    Ok. Now it all might sound a bit like a anti-testing rant, but it's not. As a matter of fact <a href="https://github.com/sobstel/metaphore/tree/master/tests">I do tests</a> ;-)

  <header>Lastly, if you don't mind could you share your current hourly rate?</header>
  <p>That's ok. My current hourly rate is ~ 100 PLN (~ 25 USD), but <s>my wife</s> I'm looking for ways to improve it.</p>
